# MR Kinetik

This repository contains the codebase for a robotic manipulator system based on the [PX100 robot from Trossen Robotics](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/specifications/px100.html). The system integrates both simulation and real hardware capabilities using ROS (Robot Operating System).

## System Overview

The PX100 is a 4-DOF robotic manipulator with the following specifications:
- 4 degrees of freedom
- Dynamixel servo motors
- Intel RealSense stereo camera for perception
- Full integration with MoveIt for motion planning
- Gazebo simulation support
