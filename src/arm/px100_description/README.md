# px100_description

## Overview

This package contains the URDFs and meshes for the px100 arm provided by trossen robotics. The STL files are located in a unique folder inside the [meshes](meshes/) directory. Also in the 'meshes' directory is the [px100_black.png](meshes/px100_black.png) picture. The appearance and texture of the robots come from this picture. Next, the URDFs for the robot are located in the [urdf](urdf/) directory. They are written in 'xacro' format so that users have the ability to customize what parts of the URDF get loaded to the parameter server.
